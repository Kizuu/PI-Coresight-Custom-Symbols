alt="DropDown Menu for PI Vision" />

## To deploy the symbol: 

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the "%PIHOME%\PIVision\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext" on your PI Vision web server; typically, it's located in "C:\Program Files\PIPC\PIVision\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext".
If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

2. Place the following symbol files to the .\ext folder

	*sym-dropdown-menu-template.html*
	
	*sym-dropdown-menu-config.html*
	
	*sym-dropdown-menu.js*

3. Place all files with *.png* extension to the .\ext\Icons directory (create if it doesn't exist)
6. Run iisreset
