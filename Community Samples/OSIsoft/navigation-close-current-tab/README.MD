## Close Current Tab symbol

This symbol is a work in progress.

This symbol is for PI Vision version 2017.


## To deploy the symbol:

If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

2. Place the following symbol files to the .\ext folder

	*sym-nav-template.html*
	
	*sym-nav-config.html*
	
	*sym-nav.js*

6. Run iisreset
