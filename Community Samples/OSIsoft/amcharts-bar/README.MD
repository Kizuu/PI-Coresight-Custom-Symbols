## Bar Chart symbol

This symbol is a work in progress. There is no configuration at this moment.

## To deploy the symbol: 

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the "%PIHOME%\Coresight\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext" on your PI Coresight web server; typically, it's located in "C:\Program Files\PIPC\Coresight\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext".
If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

2. Place the following symbol files to the .\ext folder

	*sym-amcharts-bar-template.html*
	
	*sym-amcharts-bar.js*

3. Place *bar-chart-icon.png* to the .\ext\Icons directory (create if it doesn't exist)
