## Event Creation Pane (for PI Vision 2017)
This symbol was created by Clark Ennis, Rob Schmitz and Anna Perry. This is a work in progress.


## To deploy the symbol: 

1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the "%PIHOME%\PIVision\Scripts\app\editor\tools\ext" on your PI Vision web server; typically, it's located in "C:\Program Files\PIPC\PIVision\Scripts\app\editor\tools\ext".
If this folder doesn't exist, create it.

2. Place the following symbol files to the .\ext folder

	*tool-efpicker-template.html*
	
	*tool-efpicker.js*

6. Run iisreset
